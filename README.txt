Transforming equation into cano-nical form
The equation will be given in the following form: P1 + P2 + ... = ... + PN 
                            where P1..PN - summands , which look like: ax^k

### How to start Interactive Mode:
1. start the program without passing any argument.

### How to start File Mode:
1. pass at least one file name at the start of the program
2. you can also pass multiple file names separated by whiteSpace.
3. each file name passed to the mode will generate the sameFileName.out

Examples:
```
"x^2 + 3.5xy + y = y^2 - xy + y"  =>  "x^2 - y^2 + 4.5xy = 0"
"x = 1"                           =>  "x - 1 = 0"
"x - (y^2 - x) = 0"               =>  "2x - y^2 = 0"
"x - (0 - (0 - x)) = 0"           =>  "0 = 0"
"-3.5xy^2 â€“ ( 2xy^2* 3 - xy^2) + (6x)/(3y)" => "-8.5xy^2 + 2xy^-1 = 0"
```
